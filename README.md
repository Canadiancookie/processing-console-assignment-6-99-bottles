# Processing Assignment 6: 99 Bottles of Beverage

In this assignment, you will print the lyrics to 99 Bottles of Pop/Beer On The Wall. You will use a for loop to print the numbers in each verse. See file included in the respository for the complete lyrics.

## Good Coding (indenting, commenting, user-friendliness, git usage, etc.) 10%
* Each line following an opening bracket { is tabbed in 1 tab
* A comment explains for loop ```e.g. for (                   ) { // count from 100 down to 0```

## First 70%
Create a for loop that sings 99  bottles of Beer on the Wall (read down further for help). You must use a for loop to print all 99 verses and the counter variable must be used as part of the print statement, e.g. ```println( i + “ bottles of pop on the wall … “);```

## Final 20%
Be sure the above code is working perfectly before continuing. Your new program should print appropriate lyrics based on the user’s age and drink preferences according to the instructions below.  
1. Ask the user for their birth date by obtaining it from a text file with three lines: year, month, day. See the Time & Date section in the reference pages for how to determine dates (https://processing.org/reference/).
2. If the user is 18 or older, the song will use beer as the beverage. If they are below 18 the song will use pop as the beverage.
