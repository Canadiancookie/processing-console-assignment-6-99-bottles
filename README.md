## First 70%
Create a for loop that sings 99  bottles of Beer on the Wall. You must use a for loop to print all 99 verses and the counter variable must be used as part of the print statement, e.g. ```println( i + “ bottles of pop on the wall … “);```

## Final 20%
Modify the program to use lyrics appropriate the user’s age as follows:  
1. Determine the users age by calculating it from their birth date. Read in a text file (```birthDate.txt```) with three lines - year, month, day - holding the numerical value of the year, month and day of birth. See the Time & Date section in the reference pages for how to determine today's date (https://processing.org/reference/).
2. If the user is 18 or older the song will use beer as the beverage, if they are below 18 the song will use pop as the beverage.
